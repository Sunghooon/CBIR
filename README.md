# Practice for Content Based Image Retrieval
This project is a practice for 'pattern recognition' class, analyzing CBIR problem.
In here, I'll engage in:
* Principal component analysis (PCA)
* K-nearest neighbors alg (KNN)
* Deep-Learning based

As a beginner, I hope to be good at Github, as well as studying throughout this work.

## Dependencies
For development environment, it will need:
* CUDA 10.1
* cuDNN 7.6
* Python 3.5-3.8
* Tensorflow(_gpu)-2.3.0
