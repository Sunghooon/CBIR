# Practice for Content Based Image Retrieval (Engaging...)
This project is a practice for 'pattern recognition' class, analyzing CBIR problem.
The dataset used in here is shopee-product-matching from [Shopee - Price Match Guarantee](https://www.kaggle.com/c/shopee-product-matching/overview).
In here, I'll engage in:
* Principal component analysis (PCA)
* SIFT feature
* Deep-Learning based

As a beginner, I hope to be good at Github, as well as studying throughout this work.
